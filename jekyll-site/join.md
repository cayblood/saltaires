### Membership Information

We are always on the lookout for talented, committed vocalists.

#### Auditions

Auditions for the Saltaires are held seasonally. Our next auditions will be held in May for the 2016 season.

* May 11th and 18th, 7:00pm - 9:30pm
* 1397 W 9950 S, South Jordan, UT 84095
* Up to 4 people may sign up for each ½ hour interval.

At contests, the Saltaires are judged in 3 categories: Singing (tone quality/vocal skill), Music (musical expression), and Performance (visual expression). Saltaires auditions seek to address all three categories. As such, singers should should prepare a vocal solo in any style (a cappella, 16 bars) and expect to do the following at the audition:

* Scales & other vocalises
* Sight reading
* Learn a “tag” with a quartet
* Light choreography

#### Attendance

Members are expected to attend rehearsals on a regular basis for the entire season. Attendance is taken at all rehearsals and performances to ensure members uphold this standard. Members who wish to perform with the Saltaires agree to the entire season with attendance levels as follows:

* Weekly Rehearsals - 75%
* Special Rehearsals (retreats, coaching sessions, tech rehearsals, etc.) - 100%
* Performances (spring show, district & international contests) - 100%
