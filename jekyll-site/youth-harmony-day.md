Youth Harmony Day 2019 registration<br>

Saturday, March 2nd<br>
Registration begins at 8:30am<br>
9am - 5pm MST<br><br>

Show for family and friends at 4pm.  Tickets for the show are $5 per person, $10 per immediate family.

Do you love to sing? Do you think you can hold your own part singing a cappella? If so, JOIN US for Youth Harmony Day! Sponsored by the award-winning Saltaires Chorus, a highly ranked barbershop chorus in the Barbershop Harmony Society, the day involves learning two songs under the direction of barbershop music coaches, free lunch, a free t-shirt, and an evening concert for your family, friends, and teachers where you get to show off the songs you just learned, along with performances by local quartets and the Saltaires! Weâ€™ll even give you the music for free from our web site after you register so you can come prepared to blend your voices with other high-school-age singers who will learn the same songs with you!

After you register, you will be brought to a link with the music for you to download.  SAVE the link so you can return to that page if you need to download the music again.  If you lose the link, you will need to reregister to get to the page again.


Sign up below and spread the word to your friends and schoolmates who you think would also love participating in this event.
