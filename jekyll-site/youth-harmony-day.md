Do you love to sing?  Do you think you can hold your own part singing a
cappella?  If so, JOIN US for Youth Harmony Day!  Sponsored by the award-winning
Saltaires Chorus, a highly ranked barbershop chorus in the Barbershop Harmony
Society, the day involves learning three songs under the direction of barbershop
music coaches, free lunch, a free t-shirt, and an evening concert for your
family and friends where you get to show off the songs you just learned, along
with performances by the Saltaires and quartets from the chorus!  Weâ€™ll even
give you the music for free from our web site after you register so you can come
prepared to blend your voices with other high-school-age singers who will learn
the same songs with you!
