![The Saltaires full chorus](/images/saltaires_full.jpg)

The Saltaires were formed in 1989 and are located near the beautiful Wasatch Mountain range in Salt Lake City. They are one of the highest-ranked competing barbershop choruses in the world. The Saltaires have been officially named "Cultural Ambassadors of the State of Utah" by the Governor, and have received the prestigious Governorâ€™s Mansion Artist Award.

### Sponsorship

The Saltaires thank the voters of Salt Lake County for their support of the [Zoo, Arts & Parks program](http://slco.org/zap/). ZAP grants help to offset our operating costs. We also receive support from the
[Utah Arts Council](https://heritage.utah.gov/arts-and-museums/about-the-utah-division-of-arts-museums).
