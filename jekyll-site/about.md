The Saltaires were formed in 1989 and are located near the beautiful Wasatch Mountain range in Salt Lake City. One of the best competing barbershop choruses in the world, they have won the Rocky Mountain District competition multiple times and have been ranked in the top ten choruses internationally for five consecutive years. The Saltaires have been officially named "Cultural Ambassadors of the State of Utah" by the Governor, and have received the prestigious Governorâ€™s Mansion Artist Award.

### Sponsorship

The Saltaires thank the voters of Salt Lake County for their support of the [Zoo, Arts & Parks program](http://slco.org/zap/). ZAP grants help to offset our operating costs. We also receive support from the
[Utah Arts Council](https://heritage.utah.gov/arts-and-museums/about-the-utah-division-of-arts-museums).
